        <h2 className='my-3' id="h2">ABOUT THE SCHOOL</h2>
        <p id="p">  From the very beginning of the past century, Adra, anciently called Aradhya Nagari , was gradually flourishing as a railway town. People from different parts of the country came to this place to join the railways. A new socio-economic clan emerged with differences in caste, creed, language religious belief and culture. A need for a separate school for girls was felt by Sri. Kanti Das. Accordingly in a thatched house, adjacent to the present building, a school was set up. Later in the year 1926, the then B N Railway took all the financial and administrative responsibilities of this school. The school came to be known as B N Railway Indian girl's School. Initially the school followed the guidelines laid by Govt. of Bihar. Later from the year 1956, Adra was included in Purulia district, West Bengal and started running under the guidelines of Education Department, Govt. of West Bengal. The school had four media: Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Telegu, imparting education to Girls only (erstwhile known as S. E. Railway Girls'’' H.S. School, Adra). Presently it is under CBSE in co-educational form, known as South Eastern Railway Mixed Higher Secondary School, Adra. The school campus is extended to three sites. The primary sections (Class I to V) run in the Campus III and the secondary sections ( Class VI to VIII) in Campus II & the higher secondary sections ( Class IX to XII) run in the main Campus ,i.e. Campus I. The faculty includes 17 PGTs 41 TGTs 17 PRTs and 15 non- teaching staff.<br></br>

The school was established when the country was under the British rule. The aim was to cater educational needs of the children of the railway staff. With the passage of time , particularly after freedom , the mission of this school was not only providing education but also pursue excellence and develop the spirit of national integration and create a sense of Indianness. In this era of technological advancement and the reign of Information and communication technology the students'’' way to live, study, work and play has completely changed. The rethinking of the educational boards to bring suitable changes in the systems of imparting education accompanied with the tireless efforts of the teachers are aimed to inculcate values among the students and prepare the students for this fast growing, highly competitive 21st century.

<h2 className='my-3' id="h2">HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF SCHOOL</h2>
<p id="p">The genesis of the South Eastern Railway Mixed Higher Secondary School, Adra can be traced back to the beginning of railway operations in the town, way back in the 1880s by the British. The opening up of the Adra railway station in 1887 helped in the gradual development of the town of Adra that eventually emerged as a railway town. Encouraged by the British Government’s Education Policy, coupled with the efforts of Indian nationalists like Gokhale, Aurobindo Ghosh and others, some railway officials, Nawaran Chandra Roy (O/S, Traffic), Santosh Kumar Banerjee (IOW), Giridhari Lala Pujara, D Leslie and E Birds, District Engineers, took steps leading to the establishment of B N Railway Indian School, for the Indian children.
